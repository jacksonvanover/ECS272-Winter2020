            A "rectangular" version (versus the original "polar" one above) from the comment section can be

        <p>This visualization shows the sleeping patterns of a newborn
        for the first 6 months of her life. Each revolution represents
        a single day with the light and dark portions representing the
        hours spent awake and asleep respectively. The top of the
        rings represents midnight. Each ring is to be read clockwise.
        The innermost ring is the first day of the child's life. </p>

        <p>The visualization is static.</p>

        <p>Examples of design choices include the use of colors, the
        unique coordinate axes, and the choice to omit legends or
        labels.</p>

        <p>The rationale behind the design choices is given in the
        comments by the author of the visualization (who is the father
        of the child). He says, "...I settled on this design simply
        because my main goal was to cut this pattern into timber using
        a CNC router or laser and install a 24 hour clock mechanism
        into it and hang it in her room. So aesthetics were far more
        important to me than visual clarity."</p>

        <p>While the visualization is beautiful, there is not a lot of
        depth to the information available to the viewer. We get
        something of an intuition of the larger picture but getting
        anything finer-grained is not easy. </p>
